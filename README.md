# **Dynamic To-Do List Application** ✨

This project presents a clean and interactive web-based To-Do List application built using fundamental web technologies. It empowers users to efficiently manage their daily tasks with capabilities to add new items, remove completed ones, and even preserves the task list across browser sessions using local storage. A perfect example of practical client-side application development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the To-Do List application up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the project repository to your local system:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SireTallest/dynamic-to-do-list-js.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change into the newly cloned project folder:

    ```bash
    cd dynamic-to-do-list-js
    ```

3.  **Open in Browser**:
    Locate the `index.html` file within the project directory and open it with your preferred web browser. No server setup is required, as this is a client-side application.

## 📝 Usage

Once the application is open in your browser, you can start managing your tasks immediately:

*   **Adding a Task**: Type your task into the input field labeled "Enter a new task" and either click the "Add Task" button or press `Enter` on your keyboard. Your new task will appear at the bottom of the list.
*   **Removing a Task**: Each task in the list comes with a "Remove" button. Click this button next to any task to instantly remove it from your list.
*   **Data Persistence**: The application automatically saves your tasks to your browser's local storage. This means your to-do list will remain intact even if you close and reopen your browser, providing a seamless user experience.

## ✨ Features

*   **Task Management**: Easily add new tasks to your personal to-do list.
*   **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved locally using `localStorage`, ensuring your list is preserved across browser sessions.
